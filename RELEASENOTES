iOS Version 1
-------------

* remove Bookmark if not implemented.
* remove debug output
* virtual button fadeout on press, highlight when ctrl selected.
* cool icon.
* when the nunifont cache is invalidated on rotation properly delete existing textures.
* freeing memory from Surfaces on rotation.
* how is alt handled (basic alt support in iOS, untested)
* Termination notification, only if active connection.
* inline data clear in tmux? Is this possible?
* check stderr writing, looks fine.
* keyboard shown, landscape on iPhone, buttons overlap. (done, check with BT KB)
  ** logic: if they keys would overlap, place the close key to the left of Esc.
  ** place the keyboard display key under the keyboard, hide keyboard display key if bluetooth keyboard connected.
* inline data surface appears to be incorrectly scaled sometimes, check. (should be fixed, check, looks ok, check with BT)
** remove recent server storage of passwords
* Termination notification, change text.
* relative paths for key transfer.
* ssh key support - download from server
* fingerprint cache/check
* hide virtual keys when bluetooth keyboard attached.
* random selection bugs.
* rendering and selection of a single line of text is broken.
* single word selection.
* selection box, slowly dims/disappears.
* copy functionality, deal with blankspace at end of line and linefeeds better, different selection system.
* warn on timeout of socket by iOS (verify).
* extra enter required after Kanji entry (can't replicate?).
* connects closed on lock, also does not report correctly, just crashes app.
* resizing doesn't work correctly on Midori's iPad mini, virtual keys have issue with undocked virtual keyboard - though only on midori's iPad?
  ** so iOS just appears to be generating spurious KeyboardWasShown notifications, I've tried to filter this as much as I can but some remain, why it's only on 1 iPad I don't know.
* possible to do regis/inline png in tmux? (inline png yes, regis no, data not passed by tmux?).
* was adding a new item to recent, every time!
* resize on keyboard hide.
* regis/inline update Surface size on resize (and clear?)
* cursor keys on BT keyboard sometimes randomly stop working (up and down).
* button to redisplay keyboard after dismissal.
* recent servers don't add if already present, just push to top.
* connect with no data, clears all recent.
* recent items write causes crash on iPad2 (unjailbreaked device).
* close connection and keyboard show buttons.
* regis clear/png clear
* fix png support for all image types, rendering modes.
* copying box should be nicer colour (RiscOS style?)
* properly disconnect, currently app crashes on disconnect.
* issue with linefeed sending in nano, save dialog - hack is in place, but really should be full unicode decode/encode.
* occasional bug in copying - appears to have been included in other fixes.
* not recognizing keyboard to resize occasionally, also poll iskeyboardshown to detect keyboard state.
* png clearing
* artifacts in scrollback on short lines in scrollback after rotation.
* recently used hosts, actually use recent hosts, back with text file.
* data entry window rotates and scales, device scaling.
* png render added back.
* copy/paste
  **hard to copy from the very edge of the screen, perhaps change to "normal" copy selection method.
  **paste supporting UTF8 (actually already worked).
  **copy supporting UTF8.
  ** need to disable copy during scrolling.
  ** need to disable small copies on touch events.
* basic cut support
* basic paste support
* scrolling - two finger
  ** scrolling after rotation issue.
* connect by hostname, currently only IP address is working.
* ssh login details data entry.
* virtual keyboard keys with graphical icons/rendered at better location.
* virtual tab key
* virtual keyboard should not cover text area.
 ** display size change depending on virtual keyboard presence.
 ** scaling bug fix with this fixed.
* when resuming display sometimes has an offset applied.
  ** showing double-click menu, typing, then hiding sometimes causes renderer to get offset. Possibly best to reset render here.
* landscape mode/rotation.
  ** rotation from landscape to portrait causes origin to be off screen.
  ** can also happen when reloading.
  ** and waking up from sleep.
* virtual esc/other keys.
* cursor
* blank characters are not printed with correct foreground/background.
* fix regis text rendering
* add back Regis.
* BT Keyboard cursor key support.
* texted sometimes being repeatedly entered - need to verify
* change app name to hterm
* japanese text entry
* ctrl and other keys.
* screen not always redrawing after clear etc. - add back semaphore + redraw_required calls.
* export TERM=xterm required.
* possible to fall off edge of screen, screen resizing.
* virtual keyboard randomly reappearing - probably Bluetooth disconnect.
